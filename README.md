The first folder contains a file with csv extension containing the input data. First, in order to normalize the data, the min-max code should be run on it, and then the clustering1 code should be run in order to cluster, determine the optimal K, reduce the dimension and calculate the evaluation criteria (Silhouette Score and Davis-Bouldin Index).

The second folder contains a zip file containing the sampled input data. In order to cluster, determine the optimal K, reduce the dimension and calculate the evaluation criteria (Silhouette Score and Davis-Bouldin Index), run the clustering2 code.
